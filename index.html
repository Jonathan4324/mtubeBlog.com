			<h4>Computing Student!</h4>
			<p>  This is my first portfolio using Html and Css. I'm 19 years old. I'm been learing about web development for 1 months at Gusto. My aim is to create game that is 
				full of Myanmar tradition and cultures. When I started playing video games, 
				I always wanted to know how they created them and  I always wanted to try one. By the way, I'm camera shy and don't want
				to upload my post on any social media.

					I'm not a very smart student in high school. To be honest, I never paid attention to my teachers.

					 because my mother had to move to Naypyiday, Capital of Myanmar at that time.
